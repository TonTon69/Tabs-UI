          <h2>Motivated to keep moving forward</h2>
          <p>
            Establishing and maintaining the momentum to push yourself to
            improve day by day is essential to building success. If you know you
            are making progress from day to day, don't get discouraged even if
            it takes longer than expected to achieve success. Always motivate
            yourself and keep an optimistic spirit to move forward.
          </p>

        <div class="tab-pane">
          <h2>Establish the right thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Your thoughts make you who you are. Thought creates a framework for
            life. They are the foundation for building the right thinking
            system. Changing the way you think and act is extremely important.
            In the journey to succeed, you will have to experience many
            failures. If you insist on keeping those conservative thoughts for
            yourself and don't change, even with favorable outside support, the
            way you think and act will not be different. And certainly, the
            result will not be better after that. The most important thing is to
            keep an open mind to choose the right and appropriate way of
            thinking for yourself, thereby learning from mistakes in the past.

          <h2>Practice self-assessment</h2>
          <p>
            You need to know how to evaluate the goals you have set. A suitable
            goal for yourself is not something too vain, nor are things too
            small and bring no value to life. To practice self-assessment, focus
            on the big picture in your life plan, not just a single goal in one
            area. Ask yourself if your plan is on track. Are you enjoying your
            life now and moving closer to your goal of being the role model you
            want in the future? Are you satisfied with the progress made?â€¦
            Answering these questions will help you evaluate the problem more
            effectively.

          <p>
            It is risky to work for a business no matter how big or how high you
            are. You are someone who works and contributes to an organization
            that you do not own. Therefore, you do not take control of your
            personal income. Success is when life is up to you, not any
            organization. Therefore, at a certain point, you will definitely
            have to create another source of income to help yourself be
            self-reliant, independent, maybe your own business, or even start a
            business. A new start is always challenging, but get out of your
            comfort zone and dream about a life in which you are free of
            everything.
